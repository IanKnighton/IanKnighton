### About Me 

My name is Ian. I'm a .Net Developer with System Admin experience, which in 2020 means I work in DevOps/Site Reliability. I've been in the *IT Industry* since 2007. Primarily in ed-tech companies, but with some stints in government and consumer electronics. 

If my work history interests you for some reason, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianknighton1/).
