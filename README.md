# About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm a Senior Platform Engineer at Deseret Digital Media, where I get to contribute to building innovative solutions and lead exciting projects. With a career spanning since 2007, I've had the pleasure of wearing many hats in the IT industry—from running cables to developing, deploying, and maintaining globally distributed cloud-native applications.

💻 I have a deep passion for coding and have honed my skills in technologies like .NET, GoLang, and JavaScript. I thrive on solving complex problems and enjoy working on projects that push the boundaries of technology.

⚽ Outside of tech, I'm equally passionate about soccer! I hold a USSF National C license and dedicate my time to coaching and developing players and coaches. Many of my personal projects revolve around the soccer world, combining my love for technology and sports.
